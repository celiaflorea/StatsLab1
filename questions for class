    lab 10
    t test in r
    shouldn't the sum of less/greater p-values equal the two tailed test ?
    difference because it is randomising the sample here?
    generally why two.sided and less/greater - rather than two-tailed and uppper/lower'??
    
    
    *note t-test related to F
    t^2=f
    
    Q on lab10 why does effect size go to 1.5? shouldn't  it be 0-1?
