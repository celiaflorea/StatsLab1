How to get the little drop down menau of options when using $ on a function?





    #if(!"devtools" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("devtools")

    #devtools::install_github("crsh/papaja")
    
    
    lab 10
    t test in r
    shouldn't the sum of less/greater p-values equal the two tailed test ?
    difference because it is randomising the sample here?
    generally why two.sided and less/greater - rather than two-tailed and uppper/lower'??
