	abstract = {In the {RI} paradigm, 5s learned passages of connected discourse by the anticipation method. Three levels of {OL} practice (2, 4, and 8 trials) and three levels of {IL} practice (0, 4, and 8 trials) were given, with appropriate counterbalancing in a mixed design. Results indicated that (a) {OL} and {IL} acquisition was a function of number of practice trials, (b) recall of prose was subject to significant {RI}, (c) recall varied directly with {OL} practice and inversely with {IL} practice, and (d) recall errors suggested a shift in the covert-overt error ratio paralleling recall, and an increase in interlist intrusions at points of near equal acquisition of the two passages. It is concluded that findings regarding degree of learning and {RI}, based on unconnected materials, can now be generalized to connected discourse.},
